            <p>The Sanskrit word vastu means a dwelling or house with a corresponding plot of land. It has been noted that Vastu was one of the greatest architect and town planning expert ever produced by India who lived thousands years ago. The king would send him for planning and establishing a town.There are many principles in Vaastu Shastra. To mention a few which involve certain mathematical calculations, Maana is used for proportional relationships in a building and Aayaadi specifies conditions for maximum well being and benefits for the residents of a building.</p>

<p>Vastu shastra rules are based on eight directions — magnetic field of the earth, five elements, the spiritual concept of Vastu Purush and 45 deities who form a vastu mandala.</p>

<p>Vastu check-list for your home</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check whether there is any cut in the south west side of your house/plot or office. This indicates that the legs of Vastu Purush are missing. This problem may indicate instability in your personal and professional life.</li>
  <li>Kitchen and toilets should not be located in the north or the north-east side of your plot.It tends of bring financial troubles.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the main door of your house/work or factory is not facing south- west. Says Vastu expert, Basantji Raswasia, “Ensure that your main door has enough light and is well decorated. It is important to avoid darkness on the main door of your plot to ward off negativities.”</li>
  <li>Use sandalwood fragrance in the western direction of your plot. This brings happiness in your life.</li>

                        <p>Numerology is the study of relationship between a number and events in life. This study was calculated in many forms and with the help of many systems in olden days. Some of the systems include the alphabetic system, Pythagorean system, etc.. Some countries have their own method of working out Numerology. Earlier Numerology was considered to be a part of Mathematics. But now it included under pseudomathematics(pseudo means artificial). The word Numerology can also be used to describe excessive faith and belief in numbers and related patterns.</p>
