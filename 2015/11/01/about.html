<p>Arun Raj Duggal is an internationally acclaimed astrologer and has achieved a remarkable position in the world of Astrology, Numerology, Face Reading, Red Book (lal kitab) and Vaastu. Arun took up astrology as a full time career in 2002, and since then he has come with innumerable correct predictions, provided remedies to reduce or cancel impact of unfavorable forces etc. creating a niche for himself in Punjab region. There are many events which led Arun in exploring the varied dimensions of astrology &amp; numerology.</p>

<p>As a child he would often watch his father offer advice to clients. His father (insert bhaiya’s father name here) was renowned for his predictions, not only in Jalandhar, Punjab but all over North India. At age of 11, he started doing face reading as a hobby and now that lead to his full time career. Though Arun had great admiration for his father’s work and the respect he generated amongst the people, Arun followed a different profession and worked at Ebony for a few years in their administrative staff.</p>

<p>Arun started astro reading for friends, family and for the acquaintances. He suggested simple solutions which would help them immensely. Most of his predictions came true. His immense success came when many people started visiting him for consultation, spreading his name to others and how Arun’s simple solution demonstrated favorable remedy to those who asked for his advise.</p>

<p>Can astrological guidance change your destiny? No but if rain is destined to come, then suggestion to use an umbrella can save you from wetting your clothes. At the right time, the right code of conduct and the right method to perform a task always aid success whether in a career, business, marriage or even life. Arun believes the actions of our past lives determine the present and on the whole the events in our life are predetermined by the combination of stellar positions at the time of our conception, birth and then at the time of the happening. Astrological guidance cannot change the course of events but the right remedy, which can be as simple as feeding green fodder to some cows, using a specific color toothbrush can diminish the impact of a mis-happening or bring in pleasure back into your life after a span of discord. Arun can give you a precise ‘YES’ or ‘NO’ answer astrologically to your questions. Arun’s methods of astrology is different in many ways from various other traditional methods. He always tells his true opinion about the horoscope without hesitation because he likes to tell the things as they are irrespective of good or bad points. He believes that an astrologer should always tell the facts as they are &amp; should always tell what the horoscope is revealing to him. Arun tries to maintain the transparency as far as possible.</p>

<p>Among various famous predictions: he predicted Sanjay Dutt’s (a famous Bollywood movie star) release date from jail.</p>
