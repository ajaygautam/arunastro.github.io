It has been noted that Vastu was one of the greatest architect and town planning expert ever produced by India who lived thousands years ago. The king would send him for planning and establishing a town.There are many principles in Vaastu Shastra.

                        <p>It is obvious that when we meet an unknown person, we try to understand his feelings by looking at his face. Face reading gives insights into your own and othersâ€™ character through an understanding of what their facial features reveal.
A good astrologer will simply observe a person, his mannerism, body language &amp; the shape of his body parts. While conversing his style of talking, his posture of sitting or standing position, where he keeps his hands and positions his legs. After few minutes observation, he can read a person like a book and can understand his problems by seeing his face &amp; observing certain physical sign.</p>
